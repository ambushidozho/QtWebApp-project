  QtWebApp supports you in writing server-side web application in C++
  based on the Qt framework. It is a light-weight implementation inspired
  by Java Servlets.
  <p>
  Features:

  - qtwebapp::HttpListener is a HTTP 1.1 web server with support for
      - HTTPS
      - IP v4 and IP v6
      - persistent connections
      - pipelining
      - file uploads
      - cookies
      - dynamic thread pool
      - optional file cache in qtwebapp::StaticFileController
      - optional sessions via qtwebapp::HttpSessionStore
  - The qtwebapp::Template engine supports
      - multi languages via qtwebapp::TemplateLoader
      - optional file cache via qtwebapp::TemplateCache
      - for all text based file formats
  - The qtwebapp::Logger classes provide
      - automatic backups and file rotation
      - configurable message format, see qtwebapp::LogMessage
      - messages may contain thread-local info variables
      - optional buffer to improve performance and reduce disk usage
      - apply configuration changes without restart

  If you write a real application based on this source, take a look into the Demo
  applications. They set up a single listener on port 8080, however multiple
  listeners with individual configurations are also possible.
  <p>
  To set up a HA system, I recommend the use of the
  nginx HTTP server with proxy balancer and sticky sessions.
